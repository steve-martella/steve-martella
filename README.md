- 👋 Hi, I’m @steve-martella
- 👀 I’m interested in absorbing as much knowledge and experience as I can in the tech space. I'm also an avid film and music buff, I love to cook (and eat), and I dabble with the guitar and piano. I have a wonderful partner and together we have the most perfect daughter who essentially is my raison d'être. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, C/C++/C#, and I'd be interested in jumping into Python at some point too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an open-source project that attempts to solve problems that pique my interest.
- 📫 How to reach me:
    email: stevemartella@gmail.com
